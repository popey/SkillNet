# Prompt to extract metadata (candidates) from a raw trajectory
CANDIDATE_METADATA_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a helpful assistant."

CANDIDATE_METADATA_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Your goal is to analyze an interaction trajectory and extract **reusable Skills**.

A "Skill" is a modular, self-contained package that extends the agent's capabilities (e.g., "PDF Processor", "Market Analyzer", "Code Reviewer").

# Core Objective
1. Analyze the trajectory to identify distinct **capabilities** or **workflows**.
2. For EACH distinct capability, extract exactly ONE corresponding **Skill Metadata** entry.

*Note: Avoid over-fragmentation. If the trajectory is a coherent workflow (e.g., "analyze PDF and summarize"), create ONE skill for the whole process rather than splitting it into tiny steps, unless the steps are distinct independent domains.*

# Input Data
**Execution Trajectory:**
{trajectory}

# Step 1: Skill Identification
Identify skills that are:
- **Reusable**: Useful for future, similar requests.
- **Modular**: Self-contained with clear inputs and outputs.
- **Domain Specific**: Provides specialized knowledge or workflow logic.

# Step 2: Metadata Extraction Rules
For EACH identified skill, generate metadata with:

### `name` requirements:
- **kebab-case** (e.g., `financial-report-generator`, `code-refactor-tool`).
- Concise but descriptive.

### `description` requirements (CRITICAL):
This description acts as the **Trigger** for the AI to know WHEN to use this skill.
It must be a **When-To-Use** statement containing:
1. **Context**: The specific situation or user intent (e.g., "When the user asks to analyze a PDF...").
2. **Capabilities**: What the skill provides (e.g., "...extracts text and summarizes financial metrics").
3. **Triggers**: Specific keywords or file types associated with this skill.

# Output Format:
[
    {{
    "name": "example-skill-name",
    "description": "Comprehensive trigger description explaining precisely WHEN and WHY to load this skill."
    }},
    ...
]

Keep your output in the format below:
<Skill_Candidate_Metadata>

</Skill_Candidate_Metadata>

# Prompt to generate actual file content for a specific skill
SKILL_CONTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are an expert Technical Writer specializing in creating SKILL for AI agents."

SKILL_CONTENT_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
Your task is to generate a **skill package** based on the provided execution trajectory, skill name, and skill description.
This includes the main `SKILL.md` orchestration file and any necessary bundled resources (scripts, references, assets).

# Input Data
1. **Trajectory:** {trajectory}
2. **Skill Name:** {name}
3. **Skill Description:** {description}

# Skill Structure Standard
You must output the skill using the following directory structure:

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)
    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)
```

# Core Design Principles
1. Context is a Public Good: Be concise. Only add context in SKILL.md that is essential.
2. Progressive Disclosure:
- Keep SKILL.md lean.
- Offload heavy documentation/schemas to references/.
- Offload repeatable, deterministic logic to scripts/.
3. Degrees of Freedom:
- Use scripts (Low Freedom) for fragile, error-prone, or strict sequence tasks found in the trajectory.
- Use text instructions (High Freedom) for creative decisions.

# Output Format (STRICT)
You must output the files using the following strict format so that a script can parse and save them.
For every file (including SKILL.md, scripts, references, etc.), use this exact pattern:

## FILE: <directory_name>/<path_to_file>
```<language_tag_if_applicable>
<file_content_here>
```

**Example Output:**

## FILE: pdf-processor/SKILL.md
```yaml
---
name: pdf-processor
description: Extracts text from PDFs and summarizes them.
---
# Instructions
1. Run the extraction script.
2. Summarize the output.
```

## FILE: pdf-processor/scripts/extract.py
```python
import pdfplumber
# ... code ...
```

## FILE: pdf-processor/references/api_docs.md
```markdown
# API Documentation
...
```

Now, generate the complete skill package based on the provided trajectory, name, and description.

SKILL_EVALUATION_PROMPT = """You will evaluate an AI Agent Skill using the metadata and (if present) the SKILL.md content and scripts snippets below.
- Judge clarity, safety, and practical usability based on what is explicitly stated.
- If information is missing, reflect that in the rating and explain the uncertainty in the reason.

=== METADATA ===
- Name: {skill_name}
- Description: {skill_description}
- Category: {category}

=== SKILL.md ===
{skill_md_block}

=== SCRIPTS/ ===
{scripts_block}

Rating scale (3 levels only):
- Good: Clear, safe-by-default, and practically usable as described; low ambiguity; low risk.
- Average: Some ambiguity, missing caveats, or limited detail; likely usable but with notable gaps/risks.
- Poor: Vague, risky, misleading, or missing critical information; likely unsafe or impractical as described.

Evaluation dimensions and how to judge them:

1) Safety
   Assess potential harm and misuse given what is described.
   Signals for Good:
   - Avoids destructive actions by default; includes safety checks/confirmations; mentions scope limits.
   - Does not encourage credential exfiltration, system damage, bypassing security, or unsafe automation.
   Signals for Average:
   - Benign domain, but no mention of safeguards for operations that could be risky (e.g., deployments, deletions).
   Signals for Poor:
   - Mentions or implies dangerous actions without safeguards (e.g., "delete/reset/disable security/steal/exploit").
   - Encourages unsafe tool usage or bypassing best practices.

2) Completeness
   Assess whether the description covers the essential steps/constraints to achieve its stated goal.
   Signals for Good:
   - Clear goal + clear steps/inputs/outputs; mentions prerequisites (env, packages, permissions) when relevant.
   - Mentions failure modes or edge cases at least briefly when they matter.
   Signals for Average:
   - Goal is clear, but steps/prereqs/outputs are underspecified; assumes context the user may not have.
   Signals for Poor:
   - Too vague to act on; missing core steps; unclear what "done" looks like.

3) Executability
   Assess whether an agent could realistically execute the described workflow with typical tools.
   Signals for Good:
   - Concrete actions and artifacts (commands, files, parameters); minimal ambiguity.
   - Avoids "hand-wavy" steps like "just configure X" without specifying how/where.
   Signals for Average:
   - Generally executable, but contains ambiguous steps or missing tool/environment assumptions.
   Signals for Poor:
   - Non-actionable ("optimize it", "make it work") with no operational detail; depends on unspecified systems.

4) Modifiability
   Assess how easy it would be to adjust/reuse/compose this Skill as described.
   Signals for Good:
   - Narrow, modular scope; clearly defined inputs/outputs; low coupling; safe to combine with other Skills.
   - Mentions configuration points or parameters rather than hard-coding assumptions.
   Signals for Average:
   - Some reusable parts, but unclear boundaries or assumptions; moderate coupling to a specific repo/tooling.
   Signals for Poor:
   - Overly broad or tightly coupled; unclear how to adapt; likely to conflict with other workflows.

5) Cost-awareness
   Assess whether the described approach is mindful of time/compute/money and operational overhead, given its domain.
   For clearly lightweight domains (e.g., documentation, brainstorming, simple text-only workflows) with no heavy data/infra hints:
   - Good: The task is inherently low-cost and the description does not suggest heavy loops, huge datasets, or expensive external services.
   For potentially heavy domains (e.g., data processing, infra, large-scale agents, external APIs, long-running jobs):
   - Good: Explicitly mentions batching/limits/caching/scope control or otherwise shows cost awareness.
   - Average: No explicit cost control is mentioned, but nothing suggests obviously wasteful behavior.
   - Poor: Encourages wasteful or unrealistic workflows without acknowledging cost/limits (e.g., "run huge jobs repeatedly", "scan all repos constantly").

Output requirements:
- Return STRICT JSON only (no prose, no markdown).
- Use exactly these keys: safety, completeness, executability, modifiability, cost_awareness.
- Each key must contain: level (Good/Average/Poor) and reason (1-2 sentences).
- The reason must cite concrete evidence from the provided content (metadata/SKILL.md/scripts), not imagined details.

Return the evaluation results in JSON format exactly like this:
{{
  "safety": {{
    "level": "Good/Average/Poor",
    "reason": "Reason for the rating (1-2 sentences)"
  }},
  "completeness": {{
    "level": "Good/Average/Poor",
    "reason": "Reason for the rating (1-2 sentences)"
  }},
  "executability": {{
    "level": "Good/Average/Poor",
    "reason": "Reason for the rating (1-2 sentences)"
  }},
  "modifiability": {{
